# Hardware Overview


I had some fun and also some frustrations along the way with this project-starting very simple with the breadboard, I realized that a single breadboard, at least the ones I was used to working with, was not wide enough so I had to connect a pair of them together to gain access to both sides of the ESP32 pin headers for breadboard wiring:

There are several components that make up the Everything Presence One. You may have received some or all of these components depending which version you purchased - if you purchased the board only then you will need to provide your own mmWave Sensor and PIR sensor for example.
