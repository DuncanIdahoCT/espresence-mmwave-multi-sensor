# espresence-mmwave-multi-sensor
My DIY project to build a multi sensor based on the EP1

![mmWave + PIR - Multi-Sensor](static/images/espresence-mmwave-multi-sensor.jpg)

Just like the Everything Presence One, my DIY version has an mmWave sensor, a PIR motion sensor, light illuminance, and a combo temperature/humidity sensor. Similarly it's added into Home Assistant by using the ESPHome add-on.
